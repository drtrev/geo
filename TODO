Add const keyword to operator overload param in types
add const to some of those functions?

remap walls to check for within plane:

normal: find 90 degree from this, this is X (unit vector)
make corner 1 origin (translate all to corner1)
work out how many X corners are from corner1 (divide by X)
do same for collision point and Y.

now you've remapped, see if it's within boundary



make sloped walls for small blocks, but have them inside block itelf, overlapping. only check for walls (getWalls) for 3x3 blocks, not 4x4 (was changed temp, see level TODO)


check bullets are appearing properly in server, then maybe make 'createBullet()' and put it in controller,
and get client to also call it


rounded bullet position, but still got some out of sync problems - client has block, server not. This could be because
buffer was full - check this crazy bullet spawning method when moving.
OK, made timer for bullets.

Hey, try this: only make sloped wall if there's not a block above?




currently there's a hack that only works if there's a bot running first (ID 0), see /hack in servercontrol.cpp
