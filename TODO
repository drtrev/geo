Add const keyword to operator overload param in types
add const to some of those functions?

remap walls to check for within plane:

normal: find 90 degree from this, this is X (unit vector)
make corner 1 origin (translate all to corner1)
work out how many X corners are from corner1 (divide by X)
do same for collision point and Y.

now you've remapped, see if it's within boundary



make sloped walls for small blocks, but have them inside block itelf, overlapping. only check for walls (getWalls) for 3x3 blocks, not 4x4 (was changed temp, see level TODO)
