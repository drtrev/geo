Installation
------------

Map depends on Motlab and SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer). SDL is a
cross-platform library used by Map for creating a window and taking keyboard
input. Motlab uses OpenAL for audio capture and playback.

Map can be built using the CMake Cross-platform make utility -
http://www.cmake.org/

The linux instructions are as follows:

$ cd build
$ cmake ../src
$ make

This will create an executable called 'map'.

Windows users: The application has been tested and compiled using Microsoft
Visual Studio 2008. First install SDL and follow the instructions for building
Motlab.


Usage
-----

To run a server, use

$ ./map -s

To run a client, use

$ ./map -i <ip_address>

where <ip_address> is the address of the server.

For a test, you can run two clients on the same machine, and pressing the arrow
keys will move the data on both clients.
