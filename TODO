Add const keyword to operator overload param in types
add const to some of those functions?

remap walls to check for within plane:

normal: find 90 degree from this, this is X (unit vector)
make corner 1 origin (translate all to corner1)
work out how many X corners are from corner1 (divide by X)
do same for collision point and Y.

now you've remapped, see if it's within boundary


Deal with hidden walls, size of player (move walls out and add walls for gaps, or check ahead?)
