Installation
------------

Geo depends on Motlab and SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer). SDL is a
cross-platform library used by Geo for creating a window and taking keyboard
input. Motlab uses OpenAL for audio capture and playback.

Geo can be built using the CMake Cross-platform make utility -
http://www.cmake.org/

The linux instructions are as follows:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../src
$ make

This will create an executable called 'geo'.
